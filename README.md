# discord-say
Discord-say is a simple open-source discord bot written in python.
It just has one command, ./say. The command has one argument, the text to copy. For example:
```
./say sussy imposter land
```
makes the bot copy "sussy imposter land" and delete the original message.
## How to use
### Hosting it yourself
Use this command to get the repository:
``` git clone github.com/catcoder54/discord-say ```
Make sure that you have python installed.
Also, you will need discord.py. In order to install it, do ``` pip install discord ``` or ``` pip3 install discord ```
If you are hosting it yourself, change the "your-token-here" in main.py to your discord token. Make sure your bot has the permission to delete and send messages.
### Inviting it to your server
Currently, the say bot does not have an invite link. Even if it did, then it would only be online sometimes so it is better to host it yourself.
